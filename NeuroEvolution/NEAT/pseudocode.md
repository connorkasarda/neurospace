# Kahn's Algorithm Pseudocode

```
L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements 
S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edge 

while S is non-empty do     
    remove a node n from S     
    add n to tail of L
    for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
         remove edge e from the graph
         if m has no other incoming edges then
             insert m into S 

if graph has edges then
    return error   (graph has at least one cycle) 
else      
    return L       (a topologically sorted order)
